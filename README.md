# Most-Dominant-Color-Extraction
The Python script uses KMeans clustering algorithm to extract the 8 most dominant colors in the image shown below. 
!![Image used in the implementation of Algorithm](https://github.com/sharad18/Most-Dominant-Color-Extraction/blob/master/Nature.jpg) 

After applying the KMeans clustering algorithm the following results are observed:
![]({{site.baseurl}}/)![Dominant Colors in Random Order.]({{site.baseurl}}//rand-dom.png)

But these dominant color boxes are in random Order. After writing a loop to arrange them in the order of the most dominant colors we observe:
![Dominant Colors]({{site.baseurl}}//dom.png)
